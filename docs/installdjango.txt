>>>>>    How to Install Django 1.4    <<<<<

These instructions are for a guided workshop for MozCamp Delhi.
For the official guide, visit:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/install/
Just make sure it works at Step V

========== Step I: Install Python ==========

== Linux / Mac OS X
1. Open a terminal/console
2. type 'python' & press enter
3. type 'import sys' & press enter
4. type 'sys.version[:3]' & press enter
If you get a number equal to or more than '2.5' , proceed to next step

== Windows
1. Download Python 2.7 from http://python.org/download/ according to your architecture (32 bit or 64 bit).
[#you only need the binary, not the source]
2. Install Python using the executable you downloaded
3. Press Start + R. In the run window, type 'python' and press enter. If you get a new window with 
a >>> prompt and Python 2.7 (or similar) on top, go to next step. If not, reinstall python.
4. Go to Run and type cmd. Press enter. Enter command 'python'. If you get the following error:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

Click on 'Start'. Right Click on 'Computer'. Select 'Properties'.
On the right side, Click on 'Change settings'.
Click on 'Advanced' tab. Click on 'Environment Variables...'.
Look for 'path' in System Variables (not User Variables) and select it.
Click on 'Edit' below it and append 

;C:\Python27\ 

to it. (If you installed python in another directory, use that)

Retry step 4. If it opens a Python Shell, you're done! Go to Step II!

========== Step II: Download Django ==========

==Linux / MacOS X
1. Download the latest version of Django from https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
OR go here: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.4.1/tarball/
2. Move the downloaded file to the desktop
3. Open a terminal/console and type the following commands:

cd ~/Desktop
tar xvzf Django-1.4.1.tar.gz
cd Django-1.4.1
python setup.py install
	#(if this fails, try) -> sudo python setup.py install

== Windows


========== Step III: Verify Installation ==========

Open a terminal/console

(For windows:
Press Windows + R
enter 'cmd' in text area
press enter)

Enter the following commands:
python
  #at this point, the python shell will open
import django

If you do not see any errors, you're ready!
